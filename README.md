# Travel Blog

This is the Astro project of my little travel blog.

You can easily use this for yourself. Just replace the markdown files in `src/content/posts` - that's it!
If you want, you can add and link a GPX file of your travel journey in the `gpx` folder.
The metadata is documented in [config.ts](src/content/config.ts).

Finally, run the dev command below to preview the website in the browser, or another command to deploy it.
You can also deploy the site on GitHub pages.

You can adjust the colors in [theme.ts](src/utils/theme.ts). As the project uses tailwind, I recommend using one of the
colors in [their palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this project, you'll see the following folders and files:
